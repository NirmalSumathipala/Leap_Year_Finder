# Leap Year Checker

This Python program checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

## How it works

The program takes a user input year and determines if it is a leap year or not based on the following rules:
- If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
- However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless...
- The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd leap-year-checker`
4. Run the program: `python leap_year_checker.py`
5. Follow the prompts to enter a year.
